# Carbonio OpenJDK

This repository contains build configurations for OpenJDK 21 and related certificate packages for the Carbonio platform. It packages the Adoptium Temurin JDK distribution along with curated CA certificates for secure communication.

This repository builds two packages:

- **`carbonio-openjdk`** - OpenJDK 21 Development Kit based on Adoptium Temurin binaries
- **`carbonio-openjdk-cacerts`** - Curated CA certificate keystore for OpenJDK with automatic certificate management

The packages are designed to integrate seamlessly with the Carbonio platform, providing Java runtime environment and secure certificate management for Carbonio services.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Podman installed
- Make

### Building Packages

```bash
# Build packages for Ubuntu 22.04
make build TARGET=ubuntu-jammy

# Build packages for Rocky Linux 9
make build TARGET=rocky-9

# See all available commands
make help
```

### Supported Targets

- `ubuntu-jammy` - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- `ubuntu-noble` - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- `rocky-8` - Rocky Linux 8
- `rocky-9` - Rocky Linux 9

### Configuration

You can customize the build by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Use a different container runtime
make build TARGET=ubuntu-jammy CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker

# Use a different output directory
make build TARGET=rocky-9 OUTPUT_DIR=./my-packages

# Use a specific YAP version
make build TARGET=ubuntu-noble YAP_VERSION=1.47
```

## Installation
